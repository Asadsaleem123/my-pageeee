                <h1 >My new journey as a bootcamp student</h1>
                <p >
                    After several months of learning in the frontend developer career path
                   I'va jumped over to the bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my solo projects 
                   and meet like minded peers

               <h2>How I stay commited to learning</h2>
               <p>I like to think of my self as a life long learner,
                   I used to spend hours and hours learning
                   then try to create simple projects with what i learned 
                   or work new techniques into existing projects
               </p>
               <p>
                   while that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                   what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mylearning-section-one-padding">
               <h2>How I got started</h2>
               <p>
                   I satrted simple and gradually grew my learning journal site 
                   I would take notes of what I was learning After each section I would use my notes
                   to not only reflect what I learned but also write a short 
                   summaries of what I learned using my own words    
               </p>
               <p>
                  That help me grok what I was learning And I realized that posting my learning 
                  summarisess helped others to learn As well and get motivated
